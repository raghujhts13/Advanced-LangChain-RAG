# Advanced-LangChain-RAG
Local Rag using LangChain+Groq+Ollama

##### Only handled single document query scenarios, questions like "what is the average rate of a ML engineer across vendors by the smple service corp" has not been handled yet. We will connect to DB where these info are available, but we can also handle this using documents itself with the help of query decomposition and successive querying strategies(thought chain with user infused logic). Will update this repo later.
